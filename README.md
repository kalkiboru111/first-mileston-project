# Colette O'Beirne Studio 

This is an artist portoflio website. It displays the work of Colette's O'Beirne Studio. This website contains separate pages for sculpture and music, as well as a home page containing some bio information and a contact page for site visitors wishing to contact the studio. 

The primary focus of the website is the artist's work. The site is therefore primarily audio-visual in content, with limited text that provides context. 
 
## UX
 
This is an artist's website. The UX was thus designed to emphasize the art, whether sculpture or music, and make that the primary feature of each page, and of the site as a whole. For example, on the sculpture page, a a full-width grid system was used, with two columns per row. This served to display the images at maximum resolution, while also not distracting from them with superfluous text. Likewise, on the video page, a full width column was used in order that the videos would be central to the page. 

The ordering and partitioning of the pages reflects the different types of users that are likely to visit the site and the reasons for which they have visited. For instance, the home page includes all of the basic information and bio concerning the artist; this information is general and relevant to every user of the site; it therefore appears on the landing page. The subsequen pages then reflect the different interests of site visitors. Below I elaborate on what user stories this site has been designed to cater to.

The following user stories are inteded to characterize the motivations for users coming to the Colette O'Beirne Studio site, and guided the design of same:
- As a visitor with no prior information about Colette O'Beirne Studio, I want to understand what the Studio is, so that I can view the art and/or inquite about commissions. The home page provides me with sufficient information to do the aforementioned, along with some images to attract the attention and "draw in" interested users. 
- As a visitor with interest in Colette O'Beirne Studio's sculpture, I want to view images of the Studio's sculpture, so that I can decide if I like it, and potentially purchase or commission sculpture myself. The sculpture page is clearly designated on a clean and centralized nav bar, which also displays the contact nav element for any users seeking to follow up about any of the works. The sculptures are also shown in big images and are scrollabe allowing for ease of moving between the images. 
- As a visitor with interest in Colette O'Beirne Studio's music, I want to listen to the Studio's music, so that I can decide if I like it, and inquire further about it or perhaps contact the Studio. The music page is clearly designated on a clean and centralized nav bar, which also displays the contact nav element for any users seeking to follow up about any of the music. The music is also show in one single column that runs down the center of the music page. 
Note: The sculpture and music pages are then separated for ease of navigation between the different forms of art, and in light of the fact that users are likely interested in either of these types of art. Finally, the contact page is at the end, as it is likely to be visited following a review of the art on the prior pages. 

A number of wireframes were constructed at the early stages of thsi project. Some of these wifreframes were moved away from in the process of designing the site itself. The wireframes are available here: [INSERT LINK TO WIREFRAME]

## Features

The home page includes basic information about Colette O'Beirne Studio, along wtih some images that are intended to attract the attention of site visitors. 
The sculpture page includes a scrollale grid of images, which consists of two separate stacked columns. Each image is hyperlinked to the image file, allowing for it to be viewed in isolation from the rest of the page. 
The music page includes a scrollale column of music videos. These videos have been embedded from Youtube. 
The contact page includes a form where users can submit their names and email addresses, as well as a text area to include any queries which they may have for the artist. 
 
## Technologies Used

Below is a list of all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that were used to construct this project. In each case, the name of the tool, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used is included.

- [Bootstrap v3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
 - The project uses **Bootstrap** for its in-built HTML and CSS libraries. 
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This project was initially committed to a git and then pushed to a GitHub respository, and deployed on GitHub Pages. 

There were no marked differences between the development version and the deployed version.
